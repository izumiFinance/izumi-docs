Concepts
==================

In this chapter, we will technically describe some key concepts and how they work in our protocol. 

*Reminder: iZiSwap is an evolved version of UniswapV3. While they share some concepts and mechanisms, they are fundamentally different protocols. When explaining concepts, we constantly compare them to UniswapV3 to highlight the connections and differences between the two.*
