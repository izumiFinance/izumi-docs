Liquidity
----------------------------

In this section, we provide examples for using the LiquidityManager contract to manage liquidity.

The LiquidityManager contract is a periphery contract. It is an ERC-721 contract where each liquidity position of a user is an NFT. 
Although users can perform liquidity operations directly on the pool without using the LiquidityManager contract, we strongly recommend utilizing this contract.
